### Assumptions/Logic
1. A shop must have at least one product. A shop that has no product to sell does not make sense. So, a shop has (one or more) product.
2. On contrary, a product might not be available in case shops, for eg, when there is no stock available for the product in any shops. So, a product might be found in (zero or more) shops.
3. A product can fall in (one or more) category. If there is a product, it has to fall under at least one category. 
4. On contrary, a category can have no products associated with it, for eg, when a category has been specified for future products. So, a category has (zero or more) products.
5. A product can have no price history, for eg, when a product is initially introduced in the market. So, a product can have (zero or more) price history.
6. But one price history record can be associated with one and only one product.
